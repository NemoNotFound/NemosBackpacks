# Nemo's Backpacks

## Description
As the name suggests, Nemo’s Backpacks adds backpacks to Minecraft.
I know there are plenty of backpack mods out there, but I wanted to create my own **vanilla-style** take on them.

With Nemo’s Backpacks you get:
- 17 colors – all 16 dye variants plus a neutral default design
- 6 materials, each offering a different size:
  - Default → 9 slots
  - Copper → 18 slots
  - Iron → 27 slots
  - Gold → 36 slots
  - Diamond → 45 slots
  - Netherite → 54 slots

Backpacks can be upgraded using Upgrade Smithing Templates, which can be found throughout the world.
Upgrades must be applied step by step – you can’t skip directly to higher tiers!

For more details and upgrade template locations, check out the [wiki](https://wiki.devnemo.com/projects/minecraft-mods/nemos-backpacks/general).
